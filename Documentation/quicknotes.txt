amount of money spent on each category
should spit out a graph
bar or piechart

filter by date range

employee should be able to upload a jpeg or png image of a reciept

nice to have camera ability to upload jpeg directly - NOT REQUIRED

once a claim is submitted there is 3 states:
	 - pending just submitted
	 - approved
	 - denied
 
 if a claim is denied, the employee needs to submit a new claim - NO EDITS
 
 employee NOR admins cannot edit or delete a claim
 
 admins can submit a claim on behalf of an employee
 
 the employee logs in to see the status of their claims
 
 the adminstrators can create and remove employee accounts
 
 no register page for admins nor employees
 
 employee user structure:
 	- first name
 	- last name
 	- email
 	- password
 	
all claims require a date, category, description, amount and receipt image

claim categories:
	default: 
		- food
		- travel:
			- start location
			- end location
			- estimated mileage in KM
		- lodging
		- medical:
			- due to face hugger exposure? BOOL
	
admins can create and delete NEW categories beyond the default ones. they CANNOT delete the default ones.

category cannot be deleted if there are pending claims in the category

all claim data should stay

when logging in as am employee user can only see their claims

admins can view ALL claims

both admins and employees can filter the claims list by status:
	- pending
	- approved
	- denied

last claim submitted should be at the top of the page

when an admin approves or denies a claim they can add a comment that the employee can see

a nice to have would be the ability to download the report as a .csv file or a .pdf

pages should load within 3 seconds

strong emphasis on UEX

goals:
	create a secure web for employees to submit expense claims
	create an admin dashboard for managing employees and claims and viewing reports
	deploying to a cloud service
	purely for tracking, no money transfer
